# Emergent Factorization Engine

Research artifacts and tooling for the Emergence cell-view engine, reorganized into a standard Python project layout.

## Repository layout
- `src/cellview/` – primary Python package (engine, heuristics, utilities, and CLI entry point).
- `tests/` – integration and unit tests that exercise the package.
- `src/cellview/data/` – packaged assets, including `validation_ladder.yaml`.
- `docs/` – design notes, goals, experiments, and research papers that explain the engine’s purpose and findings.
- `logs/` – runtime artifacts generated by `cellview.cli.run_cellview`; excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.

## Getting started

1. Create an isolated environment: `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`.
2. Install the package in editable mode: `pip install -e .`.
3. Explore the CLI: `python -m cellview.cli.run_cellview --help`.
4. Run the suite: `python -m pytest`.

Logs land under `logs/` (ignored by git), so you can re-run experiments without bloating the repository.
